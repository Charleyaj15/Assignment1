        <p>Hello, my name Charle Yang and I am a student studying the course ‘Bachelors of Information Technology’. I’ve chosen to study this course to have a better understanding of Information technology and this course seems to be the best at reaching my goals. Out of all the other subjects I had in school, I found Information technology the most interesting and engaging and so I have been trying to study IT, to hopefully get a job in it after I graduate.</p>

        <h3>Interest in Information technology</h3>
        <p>I’ve been interested in IT when I first interacted with my computer when I was a kid wandering how it worked. This sparked my interest in computer and IT. When I went to high school I was further interested in IT again when working on a project in my IT class which I found the most joy in and made me want to select it as one of my electives in my senior years. Although I have not been taught much code at high school, I have done projects related to database, website design, product design and animation with Excel and Adobe in which I had a lot of fun and engagement doing.
I came to RMIT as it seemed to be the best place to further my understanding in IT as I’ve only done the design part of IT and it seems to open a lot of opportunities to me in my career choice.
I expect to have a better understanding of IT in general and programming and code by studying this course.
