        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <h1>Overview:</h1>
      <p>The project that I will be creating is a simple video game. The video game will incorporate the W, A, S & D keys for movement and other keys like J, K & L to complete tasks to further the game and make it more intractable. The game centres on a character that the player is playing as and by using the W, A, S & D keys, it moves the character. The game will be an action game that focuses on the player’s hand-eye coordination and reaction time. The game will try to be as challenging to most players and feel satisfying when the player completes the game.</p>
      <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>The reason why I chose this project is because I personally enjoy video games myself but I am curious to see how it is made, so I’ve decided to try to make my own with a team. I believe that by creating and testing out this game it would further help me with improving on my programming and coding skills as these skills are needed when making a game usually. I also believe that it would also help improve some areas such as testing, being experienced when facing with problems and/or bugs and etc. which would help me take another step to reaching my ideal job.</p>
      <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The game will be centred on the player playing as a character and having control over said character. The player can move the character using the W, A, S & D to move up, left, down and right. The game’s camera angle will be in third person and fixated on the player’s character and will move with the character. The character will also be completing different tasks by using different keys on the keyboard. For example, the by pressing the ‘U’ key it picks up an item near the character in the game and moves with the character until they press the ‘I’ key to drop the item.
The game will have a story that will move forward as the player further completes tasks in the game. The story will have to try and motivate the player to keep playing and see the ending to the story and game and make them feel invested in it. The story should also be optional for the players that just want a challenge or enjoy themselves, so only those who actively listen and pay attention can see the story unfold. By making the story optional it makes it so that players that don’t play for the story don’t run into a challenge that they can’t solve and enjoy because they haven’t been paying attention to the story as they complete the game. The game will be action based and require the player to put some effort to complete tasks. By making the game challenging to the player, it would make them more satisfied when they are able to complete the tasks. Action genre games are usually based on how physically challenging the games are (like for example reacting fast enough to avoid a problem) and so to make it more interesting I may have to also make it a bit mentally challenging forcing the players to think by adding puzzles to appeal to not just the gamers that not just enjoy the action genre but also enjoy puzzles. To make the game not too challenging for most players the application of a save point or checkpoints would be important as no one really likes to lose all of their progress and start at the beginning every time they fail a task. Due to this making the game less challenging an option to turn on and off save points or checkpoints may be considered when developing the game. Although the game will be played on desktop it may be viable to make it playable and run on mobile if possible, so that it may attract people that prefer to play on mobile rather than desktop. A settings to the game would be helpful to the player as they can play how they would like to, such as sound & music, brightness or colour and key binds. For example, if a player didn’t want to listen to the music in the game they can turn down the music or just turn it off and play their own in the background.

    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
      <p>A desktop and/or laptop would be needed in making and editing the game as they would be running a software to make it. The software that would be used to make and edit the game would most likely be ‘Unity’ as it is usually used to make games both 2D and 3D which helps by giving me more options to work with. Unity is also a good choice because it is free to download and compatible with most desktop and laptops. Softwares such as Adobe Photoshop may be very helpful with the designing components of the project such as the maps, objects, characters and etc.</p>
    <h1>Skills required</h1>
      <p>The skill that may be the most important would be coding as it serves to make the game work, like moving around and interaction. The skill to work using ‘Unity’ would be very helpful as it is the main software that is going to be used to make the game. Skills in art would help with the design of the project and experience in using Adobe Photoshop and traditional art (pencil and paper) would further help with the design. Skills that relate to storytelling and writing a good narrative would be important when writing the story and incorporating it into the game. These skills can be fairly reasonable to find and acquire.</p>
      <h1>Outcome</h1>
      <p>If the project is successful then releasing it publicly to be tested would be a good idea to see how people react and play the game. By doing so we can gather data to see if there are any other problems or bugs that can be fixed that we have not yet identified. If the game is successful in its release then we could further improve it, add more to the game or if possible create a sequel to the game.</p>
