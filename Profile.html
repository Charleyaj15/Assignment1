      <p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behaviour – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!” </p>
      <h1>Strengths</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.</p>
        <p>Passionate – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust. </p>
      </ul>
      <h1>Weakness</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>Overly Competitive – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.</p>
        <p>Unpredictable – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.</p>
      </ul>

      <p>Visual learner</p>
      <p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

        <p>What these results mean to me?</p>
        <p>What these results mean to me is what I may be better at and what I may be bad at. It also tells me on what I may need to improve on to reach my goals.</p>
        <p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
        <p>The results tell me I may favour working in silence and alone than as a team and so I will try to make the effort on trying to communicate more with my teammates and corporate with them more then I would usually. I should also try to be less competitive to avoid any problems with the team. </p>
        <p>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
        <p>Due to my results being introverted, When I’m forming a team the first impressions would be important to me because it could help establish the type of person that I am, so they would have a better understanding of what I am about and make it so that I can become more comfortable to talk to rather than them not talking to due to a misunderstanding.</p>
