        <p>The role in this advertisement requires the employee to complete/do tasks and activities that relate to designing, building, testing and maintaining IT applications. It also requires the worker to produce high quality results and meet the needs of businesses. This position is centred around providing support and assisting to help in complex programs of work. This appeals to me due to it being similar to the projects I’ve done in the past which helps me to familiarize with what I may have to work with such as trying to meet the needs of a client.
The skills required in this area are experience in web development, experience in using JavaScript, understanding of design patterns, experience in Visual Studio, SQL, .Net, and REST services, experience in unit testing, applying technical skills to design, implement and support workable solutions to meet business requirements, research of tools and methods to further improve IT platform and what it can do, following department standards and guidelines for a computer’s application maintenance and development, participation in the development life cycle (such as analysis, design, testing, etc), to be able to work with team members and collaborate with others, be able to do problem solving and understand change control and release management procedures, providing help and advice, ability to do complex activities related with development and/or support of computer applications, meet business needs by using technical skills, research and develop continuous improvement processes to better procedures of current and new work practices, develop and maintain necessary levels of expertise and take responsibility for sharing knowledge with others.

</p>
      <p>The skills I have from the requirements are participation in the development cycle, work with team members and collaboration with others, problem solving, providing help and advice, take responsibility for sharing knowledge with others.</p>
      <p>The skills that I don’t have I plan to attain most of them through the RMIT bachelor course such as learning JavaScript in my Information technology course, using SQL in the practical database concepts course and getting experience with unit testing in the programming course.</p>
